Serving as a teaching assistant for Professor [Renfen Hu](http://irishu.cn/)'s *Natural Language Processing* course.

My responsibilities included:

- Developing a [concise manual on linear algebra](https://github.com/YpLarryWang/ML-NOTES-2023/blob/main/elegantbook-cn.pdf) and conducting four supplementary classes (totaling 12 hours) to introduce essential linear algebra concepts for NLP research. These sessions emphasized geometric intuition for students without prior background in the subject.

- Facilitating 4 tutorial sessions, demonstrating practical code implementation of common NLP tasks. I created and maintained a comprehensive [tutorial repository](https://github.com/YpLarryWang/nlp-tasks-examples-icip) showcasing model training and fine-tuning techniques using PyTorch and ðŸ¤—Transformers. This included implementations of models such as TextCNN, LSTM, BERT, and T5 for tasks like text classification and machine translation, as well as fine-tuning large language models such as Qwen for specialized applications like brain teasers.

- Enhancing and extending [asynchronous API call code](https://github.com/YpLarryWang/nlp-tasks-examples-icip/tree/main/llm-api) originally designed for [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py) to support a wider range of models, including Claude and the LLaMA series, from various providers.
