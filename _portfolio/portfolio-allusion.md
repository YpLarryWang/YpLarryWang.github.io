In this project, we constructed a database and annotated corpus to automatically recognize classical allusions in texts, supporting humanities research and Chinese language education through model evaluation and application in language learning. This project resulted in a journal paper titled "*Construction and Application of Ancient Chinese Allusion Resource Database*," which has been accepted by the Journal of Chinese Information Processing (CSSCI) and is scheduled for publication in November 2024.
